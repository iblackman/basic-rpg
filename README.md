After that you are ready to go, just open the scene `main` inside the folder `Assests/_scenes/`

## Contributions
If you want to contribute you are welcome to, but if you use a new asset package, add it to the `.gitignore` and in the **Config** part. Otherwise you will add all the assets to the git repository.
